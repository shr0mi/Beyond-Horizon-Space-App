# Beyond-Horizon-Space-App

Beyond horizon is an app we have developed that addresses the issue posed by the difficulty in simulating the skies of planets other than the Earth, namely the exoplanets. Our app meticulously combines data from GAIA DR3 and NASA Exoplanet Archive to efficiently simulate the skies of exoplanets. Our app also features high-quality image exportation and constellation drawing facilities.

## Note for developer

The "Data Analysis" folder contains the python script that writes data in different .txt files. In order for changing data one must paste those files inside "Assets/StreamingAssests/". The python script also uses a .csv file which you can acquire using the ADQL query from documentation.
